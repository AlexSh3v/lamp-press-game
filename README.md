Protect Switch, a lone lamp, from a constant barrage of enemies coming from above. Your goal is to survive without wasting health and charge your friend, Battery, to full capacity. But don't worry, you're not alone - you've got two special perks to help you out.

First, there's Multi Arrow: with a single click, you'll unleash a swarm of 10+ cursors to push back enemies and give you some breathing room. And when things get really tough, activate Dead Eye - just like in the Wild West, time slows down, and a yellow glow takes over the screen. Take aim, and unleash a hail of bullets to clear the screen of enemies. 

GET READY!
